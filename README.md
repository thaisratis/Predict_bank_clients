# Predict_bank_clients

This repository contains a project that predicts whether the customer left the bank or not.

The prediction was performed with classification algorithms:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM);
- K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN);
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN);
- Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (Xgboost).

Also I performed a over-sampling technique using:
- Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE);
- Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN).
